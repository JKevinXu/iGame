# Digital Catan: Island Empire - Game Design Document

## Overview
**Game Title:** Island Empire  
**Genre:** Strategy/Board Game Adaptation  
**Platform:** iOS (UIKit + SpriteKit for board visualization)  
**Target Audience:** Strategy game enthusiasts, ages 12+  
**Player Count:** 2-4 players (local multiplayer + AI)  
**Session Length:** 30-60 minutes  

## Core Concept
A faithful digital adaptation of Settlers of Catan with enhanced visual presentation, AI opponents, tutorial system, and additional gameplay modes. Players compete to build settlements, cities, and roads while trading resources and expanding their civilization across a hexagonal island.

## Game Mechanics

### Victory Conditions
- **Primary Goal:** First player to reach 10 victory points wins
- **Victory Point Sources:**
  - Settlement: 1 point each
  - City: 2 points each  
  - Longest Road: 2 points (minimum 5 road segments)
  - Largest Army: 2 points (minimum 3 knight cards)
  - Development Cards: Some cards worth 1 point each

### Resource System
```swift
enum ResourceType: CaseIterable {
    case brick    // From hills
    case lumber   // From forests  
    case wool     // From pastures
    case grain    // From fields
    case ore      // From mountains
}
```

### Hex Tile Types
- **Hills:** Produce brick (probability tokens 2-12)
- **Forests:** Produce lumber
- **Pastures:** Produce wool  
- **Fields:** Produce grain
- **Mountains:** Produce ore
- **Desert:** No production, robber starts here

### Building System
```swift
struct BuildingCosts {
    static let road = [lumber: 1, brick: 1]
    static let settlement = [lumber: 1, brick: 1, wool: 1, grain: 1]
    static let city = [ore: 3, grain: 2]
    static let developmentCard = [ore: 1, wool: 1, grain: 1]
}
```

## Digital Enhancements

### Visual Presentation
- **3D Isometric Board:** Beautiful rendered hexagonal tiles
- **Animated Dice:** Physics-based dice rolling with satisfying animations
- **Resource Animations:** Resources "flowing" from tiles to player inventories
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Day/night cycle, weather effects for atmosphere
- **Particle Effects:** Sparkles for new buildings, dust clouds for robber movement

### User Interface

}
```
